Setting up a Virtual Environment in VSCode on a Windows machine:

1. Open a command prompt terminal. Do not use powershell because its default settings will not allow you to run scripts.
2. Type the following command to create a new virtual environment: python -m venv <name_of_virtual_environment>
3. Type the following command to activate the virtual environment: <name_of_virtual_environment>\Scripts\activate
