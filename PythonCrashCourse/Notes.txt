Styling conventions: 
    class names should be capitalized and written in CamelCaps
    instance and module names should be written in lowercase with underscores btw words
    write import statements for modules from standard library first
    add blank line and then import statements for modules you wrote

Testing:
    write tests for the most critical behaviors of your functions and classes
    but don't aim for full coverage in early projects unless you have a specific reason to do so
        a test with full coverage includes a full range of unit tests 
        covering all the possible ways you can use a function
